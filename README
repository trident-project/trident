Trident
======

Trident is a Python package for creating synthetic absorption-line spectra
from astrophysical hydrodynamics simulations.  It utilizes the yt package
to read in simulation datasets and extends it to provide realistic
synthetic observations appropriate for studies of the interstellar,
circumgalactic, and intergalactic media.

For more information about the package and to read our documentation, please
