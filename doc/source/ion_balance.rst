Adding Ion Fields
=================

In addition to being able to create absorption spectra, 
Trident can be used to postprocess datasets to add fields for ions not
explicitly tracked in the simulation.  These can later be analyzed
using the standard yt analysis packages.  This page provides some examples
as to how these fields can be generated and analyzed.

How does it work?
-----------------

When you installed Trident, you were forced to download an ion table, a
data table consisting of dimensions in density, temperature, and redshift.
This ion table was constructed by running many independent Cloudy instances
to approximate the ionization states of all ionic species of the first 30
elements.  The ionic species were calculated assuming collisional
ionization equilibrium based on different density and
temperature values and photoionization from a metagalactic ultraviolet
background unique to each ion table.  The currently preferred ion table
uses the Haardt Madau 2012 model.  You can change your default
ionization model by changing your config file (see: :ref:`manual-config`), or
by specifying it directly in the ``ionization_table`` keywords of the following
functions.

By following the process below, you will add different ion fields to your
dataset based on the above assumptions using the dataset's redshift, and
the values of density, temperature, and metallicity found for each gas parcel
in your dataset.

Generating species fields
-------------------------

As always, we first need to import yt and Trident and then we load up a
dataset::

   import yt
   import trident
   fn = 'enzo_cosmology_plus/RD0009/RD0009'
   ds = yt.load(fn)

To add ion fields we use the :class:`~trident.ion_balance.add_ion_fields` function.  This
will add fields for whatever ions we specify in the form of:

    * Ion fraction field. e.g. ``Mg_p1_ion_fraction``
    * Number density field. e.g. ``Mg_p1_number_density``
    * Density field. e.g. ``Mg_p1_density``
    * Mass field. e.g. ``Mg_p1_mass``

.. note::

    Trident follows `yt's naming convention
    <http://ytep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/YTEPs/YTEP-0003.html#molecular-and-atomic-species-names>`_
    for atomic, molecular, and ionic species fields.  In short, the ionic
    prefix consists of the element and the number of times ionized it is:
    e.g. H I = ``H_p0``, Mg II = ``Mg_p1``, O VI = ``O_p5`` (p is for plus).

Let's add fields for O VI (five-times-ionized oxygen)::

   trident.add_ion_fields(ds, ions=['O VI'])

To show how one can use this newly generated field, we'll make a projection
of the O VI number density field to show its column density map::

   proj = yt.ProjectionPlot(ds, "z", "O_p5_number_density")
   proj.save()

which produces:

.. image:: trident-docs-images/ions/RD0009_Projection_z_O_p5_number_density.png

We can similarly create a phase plot to show where the O VI mass lives as a
function of density and temperature::

   # we need to create a data object from the dataset to make a phase plot
   ad = ds.all_data()
   phase = yt.PhasePlot(ad, "density", "temperature", ["O_p5_mass"],
                        weight_field="O_p5_mass", fractional=True)
   phase.save()

resulting in:
