Installation
============

Follow these steps to successfully install Trident and its dependencies.

.. _versions:

Versions of Trident
-------------------

There are two versions of Trident: the `stable version
<http://trident.readthedocs.io/en/stable>`_, and the `developent version
<http://trident.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_.  The stable version is tried and
tested, and it operates on the most recent stable version of yt.  The
development version is actively being updated with new features, and it is
also tied to the development version of yt, so occasionally unforseen bugs
can crop up as these new features are added.

If you are dealing with an SPH or Voronoi Tesselation code like Gadget, Gizmo,
AREPO, Gasoline, or Changa, you will get best and fastest results from using the
development versions of Trident and yt, since there have been a number of
updates to these codes to better treat particle data natively (previously
referred to as the demeshening.  For more details about the demeshening, see
`this notebook
<https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/trident-project.org/notebooks/trident_demesh_install.ipynb>`_.

The installation steps are slightly different between the two versions, in that
the stable version of Trident requires a stable release of yt, whereas
the development version of Trident requires the development version of yt, both
built from source.  Don't worry if you want to change later, you can always
switch between the two versions easily enough by following the directions in
:ref:`uninstallation`.

.. _step-1:

Step 1: Install yt
------------------

`yt <http://yt-project.org>`_ is a python-based software package for the
analysis and visualization of a variety of different datasets, including
astrophysical hydrodynamical data.  yt is a dependency of Trident, so you
must install it before Trident will work.  There are several methods for
installing yt, which are all discussed in detail in the `yt installation
documentation <http://yt-project.org/doc/installing.html>`_.

We find that the easiest way to install yt is with the all-in-one install
script, which installs yt and its dependencies via a new conda installation::

    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yt-project/yt/master/doc/install_script.sh
    $ ... edit the install_script.sh to mark INST_SCIPY=1, INST_ASTROPY=1,
    $ ... and INST_YT_SOURCE=1
    $ bash install_script.sh
    $ ... update your path flag as described by the install_script.sh

Alternatively, if you already have conda installed, you can skip the commands
above and just run the following command to get yt and its dependencies.
To get the nightly build of the development version of yt, type::

    $ conda install -c http://use.yt/with_conda/ -c conda-forge yt

Step 2: Install Trident
-----------------------

Installing the Stable Release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can install the most recent stable release of Trident using pip::

    $ pip install trident

.. _install-dev:

Installing the Development Version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get the development version, you'll pull the source code from its
repository using git, which should be installed as part of your yt
installation.  If it isn't try: ``conda install git``.  After that, you'll
use pip to install the source directly. The development version of Trident
requires the yt-4.0 development version of yt as well. Go to your desired
source code installation directory and run::

    $ # install yt
    $ git clone https://github.com/yt-project/yt --branch=yt-4.0
    $ cd yt
    $ pip install -e .
    $ cd ..
    $ # install trident
    $ git clone https://github.com/trident-project/trident
    $ cd trident
    $ pip install -e .

.. _step-3:

Step 3: Get Ionization Table and Verify Installation
----------------------------------------------------

In order to calculate the ionization fractions for various ions from
density, temperature, metallicity fields, you will need an ionization table
datafile and a configuration file.  Because this datafile can be large, it is
not packaged with the main source code.  The first time that you import
Trident, you will be prompted to download these files through a series of
interactive prompts.  **This step requires an internet connection the first
time you run it.** To initiate this directly, run the ``trident.auto_config()``.

In addition, Trident provides a simple test function to verify that your
install is functioning correctly.  This function not only tries to set up
your configuration and download your ion table file, but it will
create a simple one-zone dataset, generate a ray through it, and
create a spectrum from that ray.  This should execute very quickly,
and if it succeeds it demonstrates that your installation has been totally
successful::

    $ python
    >>> import trident
    >>> trident.auto_config()
    ...Series of Interactive Prompts...
    >>> trident.verify()

If you cannot directly access the internet on this computer, or you lack write
access to your ``$HOME`` directory, or this step fails for any reason, please
follow our documentation on :ref:`manual-config`.

.. _step-4:

Step 4: Science!
----------------

Congratulations, you're now ready to use Trident!  Please refer to the
documentation for how to use it with your data or with one of our sample
datasets.  Please join our :ref:`mailing list
<mailing-list>` for announcements and when new features are added to the code.

.. _manual-config:

Manually Installing your Ionization Table
-----------------------------------------

If for some reason you are unable to install the config file and ionization
table data automatically, you must set it up manually.  When Trident runs,
it looks for a configuration file called ``config.tri`` in the
``$HOME/.trident`` directory or alternatively in the current working
directory (for users lacking write access to their ``$HOME`` directories).
This configuration file is simple in that it tells Trident a few things about
your install including the location and filename of your desired ionization
table.  Manually create a text file called ``config.tri`` with contents
following the form::

    [Trident]
    ion_table_dir = ~/.trident
    ion_table_file = hm2012_hr.h5

To manually obtain an ion table datafile, download and gunzip one from:
http://trident-project.org/data/ion_table .  While the ``config.tri`` file needs
to exist in your ``$HOME/.trident`` directory or in the working directory
when you import trident, the ion_table datafile can exist anywhere on the
file system.  Just assure that the config file points to the proper location
and filename of the ion table datafile.

Now, to confirm everything is working properly, verify your installation
following :ref:`step-3`.  If this fails or you have additional problems,
please contact our mailing list.

.. _uninstallation:

Uninstallation or Switching Code Versions
-----------------------------------------

Uninstallation of the Trident source code is easy.  If you installed the
stable version of the code via pip, just run::

    $ pip uninstall trident

If you installed the dev version of Trident, you'll have to delete the source
as well::

    $ pip uninstall trident
    $ rm -rf </path/to/trident/repo>

If you want to switch between the two stable and development versions, just
*uninstall* your version of the code as above, and then install the desired
version as described in :ref:`install-trident`

To fully remove the code from your system, remember to remove any ion table
datafiles you may have downloaded in your ``$HOME/.trident`` directory,
and follow the instructions for how to `uninstall yt
<http://yt-project.org/docs/dev/installing.html>`_.

.. _updating:

Updating to the Latest Version
------------------------------

If you want more recent features, you should periodically update your Trident
codebase.

Updating to the Latest Stable Release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you installed the "stable" version of the code using pip, then
you can easily update your trident and yt installations::

    $ pip install -U trident
    $ yt update

Updating to the Latest Development Version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you installed the "development" version of the code, it's slightly more
involved::

    $ cd <path/to/trident/repo>
    $ git pull origin master
    $ pip install -e .
    $ yt update

For more information on updating your yt installation, see the `yt update
instructions
<http://yt-project.org/docs/dev/installing.html#updating-yt-and-its-dependencies>`_.
