Help
====

If you run into problems with any aspect of Trident, please follow the
steps below.  Don't worry, we'll help you get it sorted out.

Update the Code
---------------

The documentation is built for the latest version of Trident.  Try 
:ref:`updating` to assure your code matches what the documentation describes.
Remember to `update to the latest version of yt too
<http://yt-project.org/docs/dev/installing.html#updating-yt-and-its-dependencies>`_.

Search Documentation and Mailing List Archives
----------------------------------------------

Most use cases for Trident can be found in our documentation and method paper.
Try searching through the documentation using the search window in the upper 
left part of the screen. 

If that doesn't work, try looking at specific problems we might have 
addressed in our :ref:`faq`.

Lastly, try searching the archives of our mailing list.  Chances are that 
someone else may have encountered the problem that you have and already 
wrote to the list.  You can search the list `here 
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/trident-project-users>`_.

Contact our Mailing List
------------------------

Compose a message to our low-volume mailing list.  Remember to
include details like the operating system you're using, the type of dataset
you're trying to reduce, the version of Trident and yt you're using (find it
out :ref:`here <what-version-am-i-running>`), and of course, a description of 
the problem you're having with any relevant traceback errors.  
Our mailing list is located here::
