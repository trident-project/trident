Version 1.1 (November 18, 2017)
-------------------------------

- Trident development has changed from mercurial to git, and the source has
  moved from bitbucket to github.  This was done in recognition that more
  people interact with git/github than do with hg/bitbucket, as well as to
  follow our major dependency yt in making the same transition.  All previous
  repository history (e.g., commits, versions, tags, etc.) is retained under
  this transition. For users operating on the development branch of
  Trident, you must re-install Trident in order to continue to get updates.
  The :ref:`installation instructions <installation>` were updated accordingly.
- We totally rebuilt the testing interface to Trident, which includes
  more coverage in unit tests and answer tests over both grid-based and
  particle-based datasets.  We now have continuous integration through
  `Travis <https://travis-ci.org/trident-project/trident>`_ that tests the code
  daily and with each new pull request to assure consistent code results and to
  minimize bugs.  For more information, see :ref:`testing`.
- Much of the original Trident codebase was developed in yt as the base classes
  :class:`~trident.absorption_spectrum.absorption_spectrum.AbsorptionSpectrum`
  and :class:`~trident.LightRay`.  We have now stripped these classes out of
  yt and moved them entirely into Trident for more flexibility, stability, and
  autonomy moving forward.  This should not affect the user as these changes
  were behind the scenes.
- Added ``store_observables`` keyword to
  :func:`~trident.SpectrumGenerator.make_spectrum` to store a
  dictionary of observable properties (e.g., tau, column density, and thermal_b)
  for each cell along a line of sight for use in post-processing.  See source
  of :class:`~trident.SpectrumGenerator` for more information.
- Added an approximate ``flux_error`` field to output spectra, since many
  observational tools require its presence.  See
  :func:`~trident.absorption_spectrum.absorption_spectrum.AbsorptionSpectrum.error_func`
  for more details.
- Made ``min_tau`` a keyword to
  :func:`~trident.SpectrumGenerator.make_spectrum` to enable higher precision
  (although more time intensive) absorption line deposition.
- Added ability to specify an arbitrary noise vector with
  :func:`~trident.SpectrumGenerator.add_noise_vector`.
- A `bugfix <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1611>`_ was made
  in yt to the temperature field for Gadget-based code outputs.  The internal
  energy field was mistakenly being read in co-moving instead of physical units,
  which led to gas temperatures being low by a factor of (1+z).
  This is now resolved in yt dev and thus we recommend Trident users use
  yt dev until yt 3.5 stable is released.
- `Another bugfix <https://github.com/astropy/astropy/pull/5782>`_ was made
  in Trident dependency `astropy <https://github.com/astropy/astropy/>`_ to
  the convolve function, which is used in
  :func:`~trident.SpectrumGenerator.apply_lsf`.  This may cause slight
  backwards-incompatible changes when applying line spread functions to
  post-process spectra.
- Replaced internal instances of ``particle_type`` with ``sampling_type`` to
  match similar yt conversion.

Version 1.0 (November 16, 2017)
-------------------------------

Initial release.  See our :ref:`method paper <citation>` for details.

- Create absorption-line spectra for any trajectory through a simulated
  data set mimicking both background quasar and down-the-barrel configurations.
- Reproduce the spectral characteristics of common instruments like the
  Cosmic Origins Spectrograph.
- Operate across the ultraviolet, optical, and infrared using customizable
  absorption-line lists.
- Trace simulated physical structures directly to spectral features.
- Approximate the presence of ion species absent from the simulation outputs.
- Generate column density maps for any ion.
- Provide support for all major astrophysical hydrodynamical codes.
