    Create a yt LightRay object for a single dataset (eg CGM).  This is a
    wrapper function around yt's LightRay interface to reduce some of the
    complexity there.

    A simple ray is a straight line passing through a single dataset
    where each gas cell intersected by the line is sampled for the desired
    fields and stored.  Several additional fields are created and stored
    including ``dl`` to represent the path length in space
    for each element in the ray, ``v_los`` to represent the line of
    sight velocity along the ray, and ``redshift``, ``redshift_dopp``, and
    ``redshift_eff`` to represent the cosmological redshift, doppler redshift
    and effective redshift (combined doppler and cosmological) for each
    element of the ray.

    A simple ray is typically specified by its start and end positions in the
    dataset volume.  Because a simple ray only probes a single output, it
    lacks foreground absorbers between the observer at z=0 and the redshift
    of the dataset that one would naturally encounter.  Thus it is usually
    only appropriate for studying the circumgalactic medium rather than
    the intergalactic medium.

    This function can accept a yt dataset already loaded in memory,
    or it can load a dataset if you pass it the dataset's filename and
    optionally any load_kwargs or setup_function necessary to load/process it
    properly before generating the LightRay object.

    The :lines: keyword can be set to automatically add all fields to the
    resulting ray necessary for later use with the SpectrumGenerator class.
    If the necessary fields do not exist for your line of choice, they will
    be added to your dataset before adding them to the ray.

    **Parameters**

    :dataset_file: string or yt Dataset object
    
        Either a yt dataset or the filename of a dataset on disk.  If you are
        passing it a filename, consider usage of the ``load_kwargs`` and
        ``setup_function`` kwargs.

    :start_position, end_position: list of floats or YTArray object

        The coordinates of the starting and ending position of the desired
        ray.  If providing a raw list, coordinates are assumed to be in
        code length units, but if providing a YTArray, any units can be
        specified.

    :lines: list of strings, optional

        List of strings that determine which fields will be added to the ray
        to support line deposition to an absorption line spectrum.  List can
        include things like "C", "O VI", or "Mg II ####", where #### would be
        the integer wavelength value of the desired line.  If set to 'all',
        includes all possible ions from H to Zn. :lines: can be used
        in conjunction with :fields: as they will not override each other.
        Default: None

    :ftype: string, optional

        This is now deprecated and unnecessary.
        Default: "gas"

    :fields: list of strings, optional

        The list of which fields to store in the output LightRay.
        See :lines: keyword for additional functionality that will add fields
        necessary for creating absorption line spectra for certain line
        features.
        Default: None

    :solution_filename: string, optional

        Output filename of text file containing trajectory of LightRay
        through the dataset.
        Default: None

    :data_filename: string, optional
    
        Output filename for ray data stored as an HDF5 file.  Note that
        at present, you *must* save a ray to disk in order for it to be
        returned by this function.  If set to None, defaults to 'ray.h5'.
        Default: None

    :trajectory: list of floats, optional

        The (r, theta, phi) direction of the LightRay.  Use either end_position
        or trajectory, but not both.
        Default: None

    :redshift: float, optional

        Sets the highest cosmological redshift of the ray.  By default, it will
        use the cosmological redshift of the dataset, if set, and if not set,
        it will use a redshift of 0.
        Default: None

    :setup_function: function, optional

        A function that will be called on the dataset as it is loaded but
        before the LightRay is generated.  Very useful for adding derived
        fields and other manipulations of the dataset prior to LightRay
        creation.
        Default: None

    :load_kwargs: dict, optional

        Dictionary of kwargs to be passed to the yt "load" function prior to
        creating the LightRay.  Very useful for many frontends like Gadget,
        Tipsy, etc. for passing in "bounding_box", "unit_base", etc.
        Default: None

    :line_database: string, optional

        For use with the :lines: keyword. If you want to limit the available
        ion fields to be added to those available in a particular subset,
        you can use a :class:`~trident.LineDatabase`.  This means when you
        set :lines:='all', it will only use those ions present in the
        corresponding LineDatabase.  If :LineDatabase: is set to None,
        and :lines:='all', it will add every ion of every element up to Zinc.
        Default: None

    :ionization_table: string, optional

        For use with the :lines: keyword.  Path to an appropriately formatted
        HDF5 table that can be used to compute the ion fraction as a function
        of density, temperature, metallicity, and redshift.  When set to None,
        it uses the table specified in ~/.trident/config
        Default: None

    **Example**

    Generate a simple ray passing from the lower left corner to the upper
    right corner through some Gizmo dataset:

    >>> import yt
    >>> ds = yt.load('path/to/dataset')

    Create a yt LightRay object for multiple consecutive datasets (eg IGM).
    This is a wrapper function around yt's LightRay interface to reduce some
    of the complexity there.

    .. note::

        The compound ray functionality has only been implemented for the
        Enzo and Gadget/Gizmo codes.  If you would like to help us implement
        this functionality for your simulation code, please contact us
        about this on the mailing list.

    A compound ray is a series of straight lines passing through multiple
    consecutive outputs from a single cosmological simulation to approximate
    a continuous line of sight to high redshift.

    Because a single continuous ray traversing a simulated volume can only
    cover a small range in redshift space (e.g. 100 Mpc only covers the
    redshift range from z=0 to z=0.023), the compound ray passes rays through
    multiple consecutive outputs from the same simulation to approximate the
    path of a single line of sight to high redshift.  By probing all of the
    foreground material out to any given redshift, the compound ray is
    appropriate for studies of the intergalactic medium and circumgalactic
    medium.

    By default, it selects a random starting location and trajectory in
    each dataset it traverses, to assure that the same cosmological structures
    are not being probed multiple times from the same direction.  In doing
    this, the ray becomes discontinuous across each dataset.

    The compound ray requires the parameter_filename of the simulation run.
    This is *not* the dataset filename from a single output, but the parameter
    file that was used to run the simulation itself.  It is in this parameter
    file that the output frequency, simulation volume, and cosmological
    parameters are described to assure full redshift coverage can be achieved
    for a compound ray.  It also requires the simulation_type of the simulation.

    Unlike the simple ray, which is specified by its start and end positions
    in the dataset volume, the compound ray requires the near_redshift and
    far_redshift to determine which datasets to use to get full coverage
    in redshift space as the ray propagates from near_redshift to far_redshift.
    
    Like the simple ray produced by :class:`~trident.make_simple_ray`,
    each gas cell intersected by the LightRay is sampled for the desired
    fields and stored.  Several additional fields are created and stored
    including ``dl`` to represent the path length in space
    for each element in the ray, ``v_los`` to represent the line of
    sight velocity along the ray, and ``redshift``, ``redshift_dopp``, and
    ``redshift_eff`` to represent the cosmological redshift, doppler redshift
    and effective redshift (combined doppler and cosmological) for each
    element of the ray.

    The :lines: keyword can be set to automatically add all fields to the
    resulting ray necessary for later use with the SpectrumGenerator class.

    **Parameters**

    :parameter_filename: string

        The simulation parameter file *not* the dataset filename

    :simulation_type: string

        The simulation type of the parameter file.  At present, this
        functionality only works with "Enzo" and "Gadget" yt frontends.

    :near_redshift, far_redshift: floats

        The near and far redshift bounds of the LightRay through the
        simulation datasets.

    :lines: list of strings, optional

        List of strings that determine which fields will be added to the ray
        to support line deposition to an absorption line spectrum.  List can
        include things like "C", "O VI", or "Mg II ####", where #### would be
        the integer wavelength value of the desired line.  If set to 'all',
        includes all possible ions from H to Zn. :lines: can be used
        in conjunction with :fields: as they will not override each other.
        Default: None

    :ftype: string, optional

        This is now deprecated and unnecessary.
        Default: "gas"

    :fields: list of strings, optional

        The list of which fields to store in the output LightRay.
        See :lines: keyword for additional functionality that will add fields
        necessary for creating absorption line spectra for certain line
        features.
        Default: None

    :solution_filename: string, optional

        Output filename of text file containing trajectory of LightRay
        through the dataset.
        Default: None

    :data_filename: string, optional

        Output filename for ray data stored as an HDF5 file.  Note that
        at present, you *must* save a ray to disk in order for it to be
        returned by this function.  If set to None, defaults to 'ray.h5'.
        Default: None

    :use_minimum_datasets: bool, optional

        Use the minimum number of datasets to make the ray continuous
        through the supplied datasets from the near_redshift to the
        far_redshift.  If false, the LightRay solution will contain as many
        datasets as possible to enable the light ray to traverse the
        desired redshift interval.
        Default: True

    :max_box_fraction: float, optional

        The maximum length a light ray segment can be in order to span the
        redshift interval from one dataset to another in units of the domain
        size.  Values larger than 1.0 will result in LightRays crossing the
        domain of a given dataset more than once, which is generally undesired.
        Zoom-in simulations can use a value equal to the length of the
        high-resolution region so as to limit ray segments to that size.  If
        the high-resolution region is not cubical, the smallest size should b
        used.
        Default: 1.0 (the size of the box)

    :deltaz_min: float, optional

        The minimum delta-redshift value between consecutive datasets used
        in the LightRay solution.
        Default: 0.0

    :minimum_coherent_box_fraction: float, optional

        When use_minimum_datasets is set to False, this parameter specifies
        the fraction of the total box width to be traversed before
        rerandomizing the ray location and trajectory.
        Default: 0.0

    :seed: int, optional

        Sets the seed for the random number generator used to determine the
        location and trajectory of the LightRay as it traverses the
        simulation datasets.  For consistent results between LightRays,
        use the same seed value.
        Default: None

    :setup_function: function, optional

        A function that will be called on the dataset as it is loaded but
        before the LightRay is generated.  Very useful for adding derived
        fields and other manipulations of the dataset prior to LightRay
        creation.
        Default: None

    :load_kwargs: dict, optional

        Dictionary of kwargs to be passed to the yt "load" function prior to
        creating the LightRay.  Very useful for many frontends like Gadget,
        Tipsy, etc. for passing in "bounding_box", "unit_base", etc.
        Default: None

    :line_database: string, optional

        For use with the :lines: keyword. If you want to limit the available
        ion fields to be added to those available in a particular subset,
        you can use a :class:`~trident.LineDatabase`.  This means when you
        set :lines:='all', it will only use those ions present in the
        corresponding LineDatabase.  If :LineDatabase: is set to None,
        and :lines:='all', it will add every ion of every element up to Zinc.
        Default: None

    :ionization_table: string, optional

        For use with the :lines: keyword.  Path to an appropriately formatted
        HDF5 table that can be used to compute the ion fraction as a function
        of density, temperature, metallicity, and redshift.  When set to None,
        it uses the table specified in ~/.trident/config
        Default: None
