Trident is an open-source Python package for analyzing astrophysical
hydrodynamics simulations of the interstellar, circumgalactic, and
intergalactic media.  It can generate ionic abundances for all relevant ions
to these studies based on collisional and photoionizational equilibrium.
It also possesses infrastructure to create synthetic absorption-line spectra
for making direct comparisons with observations.

For detailed installation directions and examples of how to use the Trident,
please see the documentation.
