About the Trident Development Team
----------------------------------

The Trident Development Team originally consisted of Cameron Hummels,
Devin Silvia, and Britton Smith.  The ion_balance module was
originally written by Britton Smith in 2008 and licensed under the
GPLv3, but is now available under the BSD 3-clause license as a
component of Trident.

The core team that coordinates development on BitBucket can be found

Our Copyright Policy
--------------------

Trident uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to Trident. But, it is important to note that these
contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Trident
source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
institution.  Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Trident
Development Team.  If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the
change to one of the Trident repositories.

With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
to indicate the copyright and license terms:

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copyright (c) 2016, Trident Development Team.
#
# Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.
#
# The full license is in the file LICENSE, distributed with this software.
